Personalized Recommender System (Collaborative FiItering)
This project aims to develop a personalized recommender system for an e-commerce platform. The recommender system leverages collaborative filtering and popularity-based models to provide users with tailored product recommendations based on their past interactions and preferences.

The collaborative filtering model analyzes user-item interactions and identifies similarities between users to generate personalized product recommendations. It considers users' purchase history, product ratings, and browsing behavior to predict items that align with their tastes.

The popularity-based model, on the other hand, recommends products solely based on their overall popularity and frequency of purchase by users. It provides generalized product suggestions to a wide range of users, regardless of individual preferences.

The project seeks to evaluate the performance of both models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to assess prediction accuracy. By comparing the results, we aim to identify the most effective approach for delivering relevant and engaging product recommendations to users.

Through this project, we aim to enhance user satisfaction, increase user engagement, and drive higher conversion rates for the e-commerce platform by offering personalized and top-rated product suggestions.
